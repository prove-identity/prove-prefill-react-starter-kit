# Prove Pre-Fill Starter Kit (React)
Welcom to the Prove Pre-Fill Starter Kit! This project will showcase how the Prove Pre-Fill standard is expected to be implemented. This project combines both the Frontend and Backend with a SQLite Database to give you a solid starting point for implementation. Spin this bad boy up and let us know what you think!

## Tech Stack
**Client:** React, MaterialUI
**Server:** Node, Express
**Database:** SQL Lite

## On The Horizon
- Complex session management using cookies
- Docker containerization for frontend/backend and accompanying MakeFile to expedite spin up of env
- Enhanced Code Documentation (updated README.md ) breaking down database models and decisions to keep in mind with database modeling
- Migration of database model to use Prisma so it is database agnostic (SQL vs NoSQL)
- More elaborate unit tests/build tests
