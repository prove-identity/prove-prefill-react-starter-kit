# Prove Pre-Fill Starter Kit (React)
Welcome to the Prove Pre-Fill Starter Kit! This project will showcase how the Prove Pre-Fill standard is expected to be implemented. This project combines both the Frontend and Backend with a SQLite Database to give you a solid starting point for implementation. Spin this bad boy up and let us know what you think!

## Tech Stack
**Client:** React, MaterialUI

**Server:** Node, Express

**Database:** SQL Lite

## Features :passenger_ship:
- Light/Dark Theming :first_quarter_moon:
- Language Localization
- State Management via React Context APIs :card_index_dividers:
- Responsive Design :iphone::desktop_computer:
- Routing 
- Hot Reloading during development :arrows_clockwise:
- User Authentication Flow :lock:
- API Middleware for authentication and authorization 
- SQLite Database integration with Database models :minidisc:
- Security Measures (CORS, CSP, DNS) using Helmet 
- URL whitelist for backend utilizing CORS 
- Prove API token management :key:
- Environment Configuration for both Prove Staging and Prod APIs
- Built around Prove Standardâ„  flow with provided documentation :100:

## On The Horizon
- Complex session management using cookies
- Docker containerization for frontend/backend and accompanying MakeFile to expedite spin up of env
- Enhanced Code Documentation (updated README.md ) breaking down database models and decisions to keep in mind with database modeling
- Migration of database model to use Prisma so it is database agnostic (SQL vs NoSQL)
- More elaborate unit tests/build tests
